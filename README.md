# Numerical-Calculation-of-the-Relaxation-of-the-Magnetization-of-Magnetic-Fluids
The program is an implementation of computer modelling of the dynamic magnetization of magnetic fluids, consisting of nanodispersed magnetic particles.
The program is intended for numerical solution of the system of ordinary differential equations of motion of magnetic particles in a carrier fluid.
This program can be useful for scientific calculations in the field of magnetic phenomena. For parallel computing, the Message Passing Interface is used.
When the program is launched, the magnetization of the system is calculated depending on time. Visualization of the obtained results is performed by
reading data from text files with their subsequent graphic processing. NumPy and Matplotlib are used for plotting.
